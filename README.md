# DigitRecognition
Handwritten digit recognition using keras' mnist dataset.

Model can be trained either using 'model.fit()' method or using 'model.fit_generator()' method.
Model is saved as 'mnist1.h5'.

App.py creates a GUI which allows the user to write any digit and have it tested. (accuracy isn't too good. Will be improved later)

Issues:
1. Model accuracy needs to be improved.
2. Code needs to be refined.
